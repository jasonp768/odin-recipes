        <h3><strong>Description:</strong></h3>
            <p>When Thanksgiving comes around, theres only one dish that I look forward to more than the turkey. That's 
            the Thanksgiving Stuffing. With its outer crunchy texture and soft chewy insides it is truly the most delicious,
            balanced meal I can think of making for this special evening. It has an extremely buttery, herby flavor that blends
            well with all the other fixtures expected on a Thanksgiving plate.
            </p>

            <p>Although most people would call this dish "stuffing" as it is commonly used to stuff the turkey
            before cooking. In my opinion, it is best served as a side item. And lets be honest, Thanksgiving
            is <em><strong>ALL</strong></em> about the side items! This recipe feeds about 8 people but can be
            scaled up or down accordingly. If your family is anything like mine, the stuffing is the first to go, so 
            the more the better! I hope your family loves this classic meal as much as mine does!</p>

            <p><strong>HAPPY THANKSGIVING!</strong></p>
