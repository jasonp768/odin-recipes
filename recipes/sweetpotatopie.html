        <h3><strong>Description:</strong></h3>
            <p>Being from the south, there is one dish that will always be on the table for any special occasion. That dish
                is the Sweet Potato Pie. A delicious southern favorite, sweet potato pie is <em><strong>simple</strong></em>, <em><strong>creamy</strong></em> and the <em><strong>perfect</strong></em>
                complimentary dessert to a Thanksgiving meal. Another recipe that is generally passed down from generation to
                generation, this is a family favorite.
            </p>

            <p>With very few ingredients, the flavor comes mostly from the sweet potatoes themselves and the crust of the pie. 
                This is a simple pie that is a great addition to any special occasion, especially Thanksgiving. So, for my last recipe 
                for this project, please enjoy the Southern Sweet Potato Pie!
            </p>
