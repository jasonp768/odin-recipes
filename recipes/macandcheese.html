        <h3><strong>Description:</strong></h3>
            <p>Everybody loves macaroni and cheese but we all know there is a difference between <em><strong>regular</strong></em>
            macaroni and cheese and <em><strong>special occasion</strong></em> macaroni and cheese. For thanksgiving, it
            just seems to hit a little different. It is usually a recipe that has been passed down from generation to generation seemingly getting better with each addition.
            There truly is no wrong way to create this dish.</p>
            
            <p>To some it is considered the most universal comfort food with many different variations. 
            With its crunchy outer layer and gooey center it creates the perfect mixture for a tasty dish. Any cheese will work but my personal preference is extra-sharp 
            cheddar cheese and colby jack. This is my second favorite dish to cook for any special occasion,
            especially Thanksgiving. Enjoy!</p>
